# comsol-sim

This file is the **COMSOL Multiphysics** agent workflow index. Its job is to
help an agent choose and execute the most reliable real COMSOL control path for
the task: saved `.mph` inspection, local COMSOL documentation, direct COMSOL
executables, a server-backed Java API session, or the sim COMSOL runtime when
that adds useful structure.

This skill is self-contained for COMSOL work. Do not require a separate skill
checkout or an external sim-cli skill. Use this file for COMSOL workflow
routing, and load the plugin-bundled references below only when the task needs
them.

---

## COMSOL-specific layered content

Choose the control path from the task and the current COMSOL state. Identify
whether you have a saved `.mph`, a standalone Desktop, an `mphclient` connected
to `comsolmphserver`, an external `comsolmphserver`, or no running session.
Then pick the smallest path that can produce real evidence.

| Path | Use it for | Evidence to collect |
|---|---|---|
| saved `.mph` inspection | Offline summaries, archive diffs, parameters, physics tags, mesh/solution metadata, and artifact review without starting COMSOL. | `inspect_mph(path)`, `MphArchive`, or `mph_diff` output. |
| local COMSOL docs | Unknown physics feature names, module capability, property names, examples, and API terms before writing code. | `sim-comsol-doc search` / `retrieve` hits from the installed COMSOL help tree. |
| direct `comsolbatch -inputfile` | Running a saved model headlessly, stripping solutions with `-norun`, regression/CI/fan-out over `.mph` files, and one-shot saved-model output artifacts. | output `.mph`, `-batchlog`, shell exit status, and extracted KPIs/artifacts. |
| `comsolcompile` + `comsolbatch` | Settled Java recipes that build, solve, and extract KPIs in a fresh COMSOL process. | compiled class, batch log/stdout KPI lines, output `.mph` or exported data. |
| `comsolmphserver` / Java API | Stateful model exploration, live property/tag probing, incremental mutation, debugging, and API work where the agent needs to ask the live model questions. | model tags/properties, run/build results, saved checkpoints, and explicit model identity. |
| sim runtime / shared Desktop | The same server-backed Java API work when the plugin's structured `inspect`/`exec`/checkpoint tools or managed visible Model Builder collaboration are useful. | `session.health`, `comsol.model.identity`, `last.result`, live binding checks, checkpoints. |

If the user already has a `comsolmphserver` plus `comsol.exe mphclient -host
... -port ...` Desktop open with the target model loaded, attach the agent
without launching another Desktop client:

```powershell
uv run sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode no_gui `
  --driver-option attach_only=true `
  --driver-option port=<port>
```

Then verify model tags and binding through `session.health`/`ModelUtil.tags()`.
Use `visual_mode=shared-desktop` only when the plugin should launch or manage
the visible Desktop client.

For the `comsolcompile` path, Java code needs chain-style
`model.X("tag").Y("tag2")...` calls. There is no public `Component`,
`Geometry`, `HeatTransfer`, etc. type; writing `Component comp = ...`
gets `cannot be resolved to a type` from `comsolcompile`. Read
[`base/reference/java_batch_patterns.md`](base/reference/java_batch_patterns.md)
before writing a batch `.java`.

### Choosing between live session and batch

These are not either/or - they compose. The natural arc is **explore live -> solidify -> graduate to batch**:

1. **Explore live.** Use local docs, saved `.mph` inspection, or a
   server-backed Java API session to discover model shape, tags, properties,
   and module behavior.
2. **Solidify.** Once the workflow is settled and known-good, capture it as a
   batch `.java` file (`comsolcompile` + `comsolbatch`) or, for a saved model,
   a `comsolbatch -inputfile` run.
3. **Graduate to batch.** Run the captured recipe headless for
   reproducible/CI/fan-out execution — fresh process each run, no session-state
   drift, no `comsolmphserver` lifecycle, parallelizable across cases.

Quick test: if you still need to *ask the live model questions*, stay in a
session. If you are *executing a recipe you already trust*, run it as batch.

For the sim runtime, use `uv run sim check comsol` when `sim-cli` is available,
then `uv run sim connect --solver comsol`, then inspect `session.health`.
Missing `sim-cli` is not evidence that COMSOL is missing: fall back to
`COMSOL_ROOT`, `sim-comsol-doc where`, COMSOL launcher/default path probes, or
the user-provided install path before reporting that COMSOL is not installed.
When the user wants to watch the live Model Builder while the agent builds or
solves, use:

```bash
uv run sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode gui --driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop
uv run sim inspect session.health
```

Confirm `ui_capabilities.model_builder_live: true`,
`active_model_tag`, and `live_model_binding.ok: true` before treating the GUI
as synchronized with agent edits. The returned `session.versions` payload tells
you which COMSOL-specific subfolders to load. Require
`version_source: active_runtime` before using release-specific notes; another
COMSOL installation detected on the host is not evidence about this session:

```json
"session.versions": {
  "solver_version":       "6.4",
  "version_source":       "active_runtime",
  "profile":             "mph_1_2_comsol_6_4",
  "active_sdk_layer":    null,        // single SDK line (mph 1.x), no overlay
  "active_solver_layer": "6.4"        // or "6.2" / "6.1" / "6.0"
}
```

There is no `sdk/` overlay because all supported COMSOL versions pin a
single `mph` line (1.2.x). Load the smallest reference needed for the chosen
path: usually `base/` plus the active `solver/<slug>/` notes only when version
specific behavior matters.

### `base/` — references to load when relevant

| Path | What's there |
|---|---|
| `base/workflows/block_with_hole/` | Steady-state thermal of a heated block with a cylindrical hole. 6 numbered Python steps (`00_create_geometry.py` … `05_plot_temperature.py`). The smallest plugin-owned smoke/reference workflow for this driver. |
| `base/workflows/model_review_loop.md` | Checkpoint loop for live/incremental geometry, materials, physics, mesh, study, and results work. |
| `base/workflows/debug_failed_exec.md` | Failure and divergence triage: preserve the first causal error, inspect live state, separate singular/setup/mesh/nonlinear causes, then retry one hypothesis at a time. |
| `base/reference/runtime_introspection.md` | Live-session inspection contract: preferred `uv run sim inspect` targets, compatibility rules, partial results, and raw Java fallbacks. |
| `base/reference/java_api_patterns.md` | Stable Java API probing patterns: tags first, properties before `set`, selection checks, and version-safe try/except snippets. |
| `base/reference/java_batch_patterns.md` | Read before writing `.java` for `comsolcompile`: chain-style calls, anti-patterns that fail to compile, source-property toggles (`<prop>_src`), study/sol skeleton, KPI extraction via stdout, error triage. |
| `base/reference/mph_file_format.md` | `.mph` is a ZIP archive — internal layout, the three `nodeType` variants (compact/solved/preview), the Global Parameter `T="33"` contract, and the stdlib `mph_inspect` reader. Read this when you need to introspect a `.mph` *without* spinning up `comsolmphserver`. |
| `base/reference/offline_postprocessing_exports.md` | Optional pattern for COMSOL-free/Python postprocessing after a solve. Use when the user asks for reusable result artifacts, full-domain VTU field exports, CSV tables, or postprocessing without keeping COMSOL open. |

Larger engineering examples do not live in this plugin skill. Keep this
plugin-owned content focused on the driver protocol, live introspection,
debug loops, and the smallest smoke/reference workflow.

Each numbered step is a self-contained snippet for the sim runtime after
`uv run sim connect --solver comsol`. This workflow is incremental and
inspect-after-each-step, so a live session is the right path for it. Once a
model build is settled, the batch
path is the better choice for re-running it — see the decision table above.

Before running a new or complex workflow, read
[`base/reference/runtime_introspection.md`](base/reference/runtime_introspection.md)
and
[`base/workflows/model_review_loop.md`](base/workflows/model_review_loop.md).
For failed snippets, switch immediately to
[`base/workflows/debug_failed_exec.md`](base/workflows/debug_failed_exec.md)
instead of guessing another full script.

### `solver/<active_solver_layer>/` — release specifics

Empty stubs by default; per-release deltas land here as discovered.

- `solver/6.4/notes.md` — current
- `solver/6.2/notes.md`
- `solver/6.1/notes.md`
- `solver/6.0/notes.md`

### `doc-search/` — local documentation lookup

When a physics feature name, API method, or module capability is unknown,
choose the cheapest evidence source that can answer the question. Local docs
are often the right first probe for names, modules, examples, and API terms:

```bash
uv run --project src/sim_plugin_comsol/_skills/comsol/doc-search sim-comsol-doc search "<term>" [--module <substring>]
```

For an already-loaded model or a failed live step, inspect the current model
state:

```bash
uv run sim inspect session.health
uv run sim inspect last.result
uv run sim inspect comsol.model.describe_text
uv run sim inspect comsol.node.properties:<tag-or-dot-path>
```

The COMSOL driver may not expose every inspect target on older plugin
builds. If an inspect target is unavailable, use the raw Java fallback
patterns in
[`base/reference/java_api_patterns.md`](base/reference/java_api_patterns.md).

`doc-search` runs in pure CPython: no live COMSOL session, no sim runtime,
and no JVM. It scans the installed COMSOL HTML help on disk.

One-time setup on any host that has COMSOL installed:

```bash
cd src/sim_plugin_comsol/_skills/comsol/doc-search && uv sync
```

(No index build step — each query scans the doc tree in parallel; typical
latency is 1–3 s on a local SSD.)

Tips for good queries:
- Use **2–3 keywords**, not questions. COMSOL search is keyword-matched.
- Filter by `--module battery` / `--heat` / `--cfd` / `--plasma` to bias
  toward a module's plugin folder (matched as a substring of the
  `com.comsol.help.*` name).
- Progressive broadening: if `"C-rate battery"` returns nothing, try
  `"discharge rate"`, then `"battery performance"`.
- For **API / coding** questions, filter `--module programming` or
  `--module api`. Plugin names follow `com.comsol.help.*` — inspect a
  few results and adjust.

To read the full text of a hit:

```bash
uv run sim-comsol-doc retrieve com.comsol.help.battery/battery_aging.03.01.html
```

See `doc-search/README.md` for discovery details and the install-root
override (`--comsol-root`) if auto-detection fails.

#### Application Gallery: local vs. web

The local index also covers the **Application Gallery** content for every
module the user has installed — those plugins are named
`com.comsol.help.models.*` (e.g. `com.comsol.help.models.battery.li_battery_1d`).
Filter with `--module models` to scope a search to example-model docs:

```bash
uv run sim-comsol-doc search "thermal runaway" --module models.battery
```

For models that belong to **modules not installed** on the user's host
(or for browsing by image/category), point the user at
<https://www.comsol.com/models>. Don't scrape it from the skill — just
link.

---

## MPH file introspection (stdlib path — no JVM)

For "what's in this `.mph`?" queries — parameters, physics tags,
nodeType, mesh/solution sizes — prefer the stdlib reader over a live
JVM:

```python
from sim_plugin_comsol.lib import inspect_mph
summary = inspect_mph(path)   # one-shot dict
```

`MphArchive` (context manager) and `mph_diff` (two-file delta) are
also available. `MphFileProbe` is wired into the driver's default
probe list, so any `.mph` produced by a `sim` run is auto-described
in `uv run sim inspect last.result` — no extra call needed.

See [`base/reference/mph_file_format.md`](base/reference/mph_file_format.md)
for the archive layout, the `nodeType` variants, and the Global
Parameter `T="33"` extraction contract.

Use `.mph` archive inspection for saved artifacts and offline comparison.
Use live runtime introspection for the current JPype session, especially
before changing selections, physics features, studies, and result nodes.

## Optional offline postprocessing exports

When the user wants Python-friendly postprocessing without keeping COMSOL
open, export reusable data artifacts once from the live or headless COMSOL
session, then process those files offline. Prefer full-domain VTU field data
and CSV/TXT tables over screenshots or slices as the reusable source data.

See
[`base/reference/offline_postprocessing_exports.md`](base/reference/offline_postprocessing_exports.md)
for the optional bundle layout and headless export snippets.

---

## Headless `comsolbatch -inputfile`: direct saved-model execution

`comsolbatch.exe -inputfile in.mph -outputfile out.mph -batchlog log.txt`
is COMSOL's canonical non-interactive entry point for running a saved
model — it is a real capability you can invoke **today**, directly, with
no `comsolmphserver` and no `sim serve`. Prefer it when a one-shot
saved-model run is what you need: deterministic batch runs that do not need
Desktop collaboration or live introspection, regression/CI runs, and
fan-out over many `.mph` files.

Call `comsolbatch.exe` directly for saved-model runs, and use
`comsolcompile` + `comsolbatch` directly for one-shot `.java` recipes (see
[`base/reference/java_batch_patterns.md`](base/reference/java_batch_patterns.md)).
A sim-managed batch lifecycle wrapper is not implemented; `sim connect
--solver comsol` goes through `comsolmphserver` + JPype. Use the sim runtime
when you need live introspection, incremental building, plugin diagnostics, or
shared-desktop collaboration.

On Windows, COMSOL batch logs may be UTF-16. If a normal read path reports the
log as binary, decode it explicitly before deciding the run has no useful
output:

```powershell
[System.Text.Encoding]::Unicode.GetString([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($log))
```

---

## Long-running execution and recovery

Keep bounded COMSOL work in the foreground when it fits the active tool-call
budget. Move a settled solve to native batch or a background process only when
it is expected to outlive that budget, must continue across agent turns, or the
user explicitly asks for background execution. Keep live sessions for
incremental inspection and mutation; prefer `comsolbatch` for a settled,
repeatable long solve.

For a long batch run, use absolute `-batchlog` and `-outputfile` paths so the
agent can inspect progress and results later. Do not require a fixed directory
tree, a job manifest, or sim-cli when the direct COMSOL command is sufficient.

A shell or tool timeout ends that observation call; it does not prove COMSOL
stopped. Before retrying or stopping, check the existing process, batch-log
tail, and output-file timestamps. Confirm process ownership from the
executable, full command line, start time, and batch-log/output targets. Never
terminate every `comsol` process by name.

Use *resume* only when a saved `.mph` or another COMSOL-native checkpoint
contains state that can actually continue the solve. Without a usable
checkpoint, describe the action as a restart rather than promising generic
resume behavior.

---

## Path-scoped guardrails

Use these guardrails in the path where they apply. They are meant to preserve
agent exploration while avoiding known COMSOL failure modes.

1. **Runtime snippets with a provided `model` handle.**
   In a sim runtime or another already-connected JPype/Java API context,
   reuse the provided model/client. Starting a second `mph.start()` or
   `client.create()` can spawn a conflicting COMSOL JVM. In standalone Python
   `mph` scripts, creating a client may be the correct setup step.
2. **Batch Java through `comsolcompile`.**
   Use chain-style `model.X("tag").Y("tag2")...` calls. Typed COMSOL node
   declarations such as `Component comp = ...` fail at compile time; see
   [`base/reference/java_batch_patterns.md`](base/reference/java_batch_patterns.md).
   For heat-transfer smoke models, `HeatTransferInSolids` can be unavailable
   on some installs; if batch output says `Unknown physics interface`, try the
   installed docs or the more generic `HeatTransfer` interface before treating
   COMSOL itself as unavailable.
3. **Unfamiliar live properties or selections.**
   You do not need to query docs before every edit; familiar paths can use a
   fast write-run loop. If a COMSOL compile or batch run reports an unknown
   property, unknown feature, or non-editable/invalid node state, stop blind
   retries and confirm the exact node through local docs or live/local probes.
   Good probes include
   `uv run sim inspect comsol.node.properties:<target>`, the raw Java
   `properties()` pattern, `tags()`, and `selection().entities()`.
4. **Live exploratory builders.**
   For stateful model creation or debugging, work in coherent layers, inspect
   after meaningful changes, and save checkpoints. A settled standalone batch
   recipe may be a single `.java` class or saved-model batch run when it has
   enough output evidence.
5. **Visual artifacts.**
   Numeric probes and exported data are the acceptance evidence. PNG export has
   been unreliable in known Windows setups; test visual export when figures are
   required, and keep screenshots as human review aids rather than the only
   proof.

---

## Model identity, workdir, and checkpoints

For non-trivial COMSOL work, establish a durable model identity and working
folder before building geometry, materials, physics, mesh, or studies.
COMSOL permits untitled `Model1` scratch models, but agents need a clear
artifact to resume from after chat compaction, process restart, server reload,
or human handoff.

Use this policy:

- For deliverable geometry, materials, physics, meshes, studies, sweeps, or
  results, create or bind a durable project identity early. Set a visible
  title/label, set the working folder, and save an initial `.mph` checkpoint.
- If the user provided an `.mph`, load that exact file and bind the session to
  a clear model tag derived from the case name.
- If starting from scratch in the sim runtime, pass a descriptive
  `model_tag=<case_slug>` when connecting if the current driver supports it.
- If starting from scratch in shared Desktop mode, bind to the active Desktop
  model first, then set a visible title/label and save it early to an absolute
  `.mph` path.
- Keep all related files under one working folder, for example:

```text
<workdir>/
  model/<case_slug>.mph
  input/
  output/
  scripts/
  logs/
```

- Set `model.modelPath(...)` to the relevant `input` and `model` folders
  when the workflow uses external files, tables, meshes, or CAD.
- Prefer absolute paths for save/export/log targets. Do not rely on COMSOL's
  launch directory or the Java process current directory.
- After every major layer, save a checkpoint `.mph` or save the main `.mph`
  after confirming the live state. Use names such as
  `<case_slug>_01_geometry.mph`, `<case_slug>_02_materials.mph`, and
  `<case_slug>_03_solved.mph` when intermediate files help review or resume.
- Before resuming a partially completed task, inspect identity first:

```bash
uv run sim inspect session.health
uv run sim inspect comsol.model.identity
uv run sim inspect comsol.model.describe_text
```

Treat `comsol.model.identity.checkpoint_ready=false`, missing
`file_path`/`location`, or a bound tag that does not match `active_model_tag`
as a pause-and-repair condition before doing new modeling work. Repair means
creating or binding the intended project, setting the model path, and saving an
initial `.mph`; do not "just continue" in the untitled session.

Scratch probes and one-off API experiments may stay as `Model1` or
`Untitled.mph`, but label them as disposable in the agent's status and do not
mix them with user-facing engineering artifacts. If a scratch probe turns into
real work, stop and rebuild it under a named project rather than letting the
untitled session become the deliverable.

---

## Live/incremental working loop

Use this loop for stateful model building, debugging, or shared Desktop work.
It is not required for saved `.mph` inspection, local docs lookup, direct
`comsolbatch` runs, or settled `comsolcompile` recipes.

Treat COMSOL as a live engineering state during incremental work. In
human-in-the-loop Desktop sessions, keep the visible model coherent at
meaningful checkpoints.

COMSOL's Java API is stateful and layered. Many `set(...)` calls mutate the
model tree, but downstream objects and the Desktop view may not reflect those
changes until the relevant sequence is built or run. Use `run()` calls as
intentional synchronization points when the next step depends on updated state
or when the user expects the Model Builder / Graphics view to be current. Do
not make this mechanical: batch coherent edits first, then choose the smallest
appropriate build/run for the layer you changed (for example geometry, mesh,
plot, study, or solver). The goal is to understand and respect COMSOL's
commit/refresh mechanism, not to force a fixed `run()` after every property
assignment.

1. Choose the control path from the table above. If the model only needs saved
   artifact review, docs lookup, or direct batch execution, use that path
   instead of starting a live loop.
2. For sim runtime, run `uv run sim check comsol`, connect if needed, and read
   `session.versions` plus `uv run sim inspect session.health`.
3. Establish or verify model identity, working folder, and checkpoint target.
   Inspect `comsol.model.identity` when available. If the model is untitled,
   unsaved, missing a file path, or lacks the intended working folder, fix that
   before creating geometry, materials, physics, mesh, study, or result nodes.
4. Inspect the baseline state with `uv run sim inspect
   comsol.model.describe_text` when available.
5. Execute one bounded modeling step.
6. Inspect the result before continuing with `uv run sim inspect last.result`,
   `comsol.model.describe_text`, and
   `comsol.node.properties:<tag-or-dot-path>` as needed.
7. Save or update the relevant checkpoint after each passed major layer.
8. Continue when the live model matches the intended geometry, materials,
   physics, mesh, study, and result state closely enough for the next step and
   the checkpoint can be used to resume.

For simple known-good smoke coverage, use the numbered snippets under
`base/workflows/`. For realistic engineering examples, use project-local
or user-provided recipes and apply the same checkpoint loop.

---

## GUI and visual inspection modes

COMSOL has several visual surfaces. Do not collapse them into one
"GUI mode" in your reasoning or status reports:

| Mode | What it means | Live with agent edits? |
|---|---|---|
| `no_gui` | `comsolmphserver` API session with no intentional visible windows. This is the canonical sim-cli default. | Yes, API session only. |
| `server-graphics` | `comsolmphserver -graphics`; plot windows may appear when a result plot is run. `ui_mode=gui` is an alias for this. | Yes for the server-side model, but there is no Model Builder tree. |
| `desktop-inspection` | Save a `.mph` artifact, then open it in full COMSOL Desktop / Model Builder. | No. It is an inspection copy unless explicitly reloaded. |
| `shared-desktop` | Full COMSOL Desktop attached to the same server, with the agent binding to the Desktop's active model tag. Request from sim-cli with `--driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop`. | Yes, when `model_builder_live: true`. |

Use `uv run sim inspect session.health` or `uv run sim exec` target `session.health`
to check `requested_ui_mode`, `effective_ui_mode`, `ui_capabilities`,
PIDs, logs, and visible COMSOL window titles. Treat `model_builder_live:
false` as authoritative: agent-side JPype edits will not automatically
refresh a separately opened COMSOL Desktop window.

### Legacy diagnostic only: Java Shell / ordinary Desktop attach

`sim-comsol-attach` and Java Shell can be useful for narrow legacy
troubleshooting when the user explicitly asks about that path. Treat them as
diagnostic or read-only unless the task is specifically to investigate that
mechanism. They depend on GUI focus, language/layout, visible shell state,
dialogs, and clipboard/text submission behavior, so they are not acceptance
evidence for model creation, mutation, solves, or validation. Prefer a
structured server-backed path for real work: no-GUI attach for a user-owned
existing server session, plugin-owned `shared-desktop` for live Model Builder
collaboration, or `comsolbatch` for settled file-based recipes.

Shared-desktop gotcha for COMSOL 6.4: launching
`comsol.exe mphclient -host localhost -port <port>` does attach a full
Desktop to `comsolmphserver`. However, if JPype creates a separate
server model tag with `ModelUtil.create("SharedProbe")`, the Desktop
does not automatically switch from its active `Model1` tree to that
new tag. When JPype instead mutates `ModelUtil.model("Model1")`, the
Desktop refreshes: the title, Model Builder tree, and Graphics view
show the API-created component/geometry. The implemented
`shared-desktop` mode therefore discovers or negotiates the active
Desktop model tag and routes agent edits to that tag.

Use:

```powershell
uv run sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode gui --driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop
```

Then verify `session.health`: `effective_ui_mode` should be
`shared-desktop`, `ui_capabilities.model_builder_live` should be `true`,
and `active_model_tag` should name the model that agent snippets will
mutate.

### Attach-only external server

If repeated API client disconnects occur, or a user wants one COMSOL
server to survive multiple sim sessions, use an externally managed server
instead of mixing sim and ad hoc JPype scripts. The user or agent starts
`comsolmphserver` first in an interactive Windows shell:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\COMSOL\COMSOL64\Multiphysics\bin\win64\comsolmphserver.exe" -port 2036 -multi on -login auto -silent
```

Then connect through sim with explicit attach-only ownership. If the user has
already opened a server-backed Desktop with:

```powershell
& "C:\Program Files\COMSOL\COMSOL64\Multiphysics\bin\win64\comsol.exe" mphclient -host localhost -port 2036
```

attach the agent/API client without launching another Desktop:

```powershell
uv run sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode no_gui `
  --driver-option attach_only=true `
  --driver-option port=2036
```

Use plugin-owned `shared-desktop` only when the agent should launch or manage
the visible Desktop client:

```powershell
uv run sim connect --solver comsol --ui-mode gui `
  --driver-option attach_only=true `
  --driver-option port=2036 `
  --driver-option visual_mode=shared-desktop
```

In attach-only mode, `session.health` should show
`server_owner: "external"` and `attach_only: true`. `uv run sim disconnect`
disconnects the JPype client and any plugin-launched Desktop client, but
does not kill the external `comsolmphserver`. Keep all agent operations
inside the sim session; use ad hoc JPype only as a diagnostic escape hatch.

### Screenshot responsibility

On a Codex Desktop host with access to the interactive solver GUI, prefer Codex's own desktop
screenshot/view tools for visual review. They see the same
interactive desktop the user sees and avoid adding solver-specific
screenshot commands to sim-cli. Use `uv run sim screenshot` only when the
solver GUI is on a remote host that Codex cannot directly capture.

When you perform GUI-visible work, review the Desktop state after every significant action:

1. Launch or connect.
2. Geometry build or import.
3. Material assignment.
4. Physics setup.
5. Mesh build.
6. Solve and result plot.
7. Save/open `.mph` for Desktop inspection when Model Builder review is needed.

### COMSOL-specific dialogs

- **"连接到 COMSOL Multiphysics Server"** / **"Connect to COMSOL
  Multiphysics Server"** may be a stale or separate Desktop/client
  login dialog. It does not prove the JPype server session failed.
  Verify by checking `session.health`, the port, PIDs, and visible
  window titles.
- **"是否保存更改?"** / **"Save changes?"** appears on Desktop close if
  a separately opened `.mph` has unsaved edits. Choose Save or Don't Save
  according to the user's intent.

Prefer the JPype path (`model.*`, `ModelUtil.*`) for programmable model
construction and solving. Use Desktop inspection only when a human needs
to see the Model Builder tree or interact with file/dialog surfaces.
